# Waveform Database (WFDB) Project

Welcome to the website for the **Waveform Database (WFDB)** project.

WFDB defines a set of open standards and software tools for the storage, sharing, and analysis of physiologic signal and annotation data. It has been widely used for decades to support biomedical research, clinical studies, and education.

---

## What is WFDB?

At its core, **WFDB** provides:

- A **format specification** for representing digitized signals and event annotations.
- **Software libraries and tools** for reading, writing, processing, and visualizing waveform data.
- A foundation for many of the databases hosted on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/).

Originally developed at MIT by **George B. Moody** in 1989, WFDB continues to evolve through the efforts of the open biomedical data community.
